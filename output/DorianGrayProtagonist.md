The protagonist of Oscar Wilde's novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray" is Dorian Gray himself, but the narrative is framed by the character of Dr. John Seward, who keeps a diary throughout the story.

However, if we're looking for the main character that drives the plot and explores themes of vanity, morality, and the supernatural, it's Dorian Gray. Here's a detailed summary:

**Introduction**

The novel begins with the introduction of Dorian Gray, a young and beautiful man who has just arrived in London. He is the subject of a portrait by the artist Basil Hallward, which becomes an obsession for him. During the painting process, Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a charming and hedonistic friend of Basil's, who espouses a philosophy of self-indulgence and morality.

**The making of the portrait**

As the portrait is completed, Dorian becomes infatuated with his own image and makes a Faustian bargain, wishing that the portrait would age instead of himself. Unbeknownst to Dorian, this wish comes with a terrible cost.

**The corrupting influence of Lord Henry**

Lord Henry's influence on Dorian grows stronger, and he begins to adopt the values of hedonism and self-indulgence. He becomes obsessed with pleasure, beauty, and the pursuit of youth, while ignoring moral responsibility and compassion.

**Dorian's descent into madness**

As Dorian's obsession with his own vanity grows, he becomes increasingly consumed by his own ego and desire for immortality. He engages in a series of morally reprehensible acts, including murder, theft, and betrayal, all while maintaining his youthful appearance.

Meanwhile, the portrait of Dorian Gray, which has become a symbol of his guilt and corruption, begins to reflect the true state of his soul. The painting becomes increasingly disfigured and twisted, reflecting the darkness within Dorian's heart.

**The pursuit of supernatural powers**

Dorian becomes fascinated with the supernatural and occult practices, believing that he can use these to further his own power and immortality. He engages in various forms of dark magic, including summoning and controlling a malevolent entity known as Quincey Morris.

**The descent into madness and death**

As Dorian's obsession with power and immortality reaches its peak, he becomes increasingly unhinged. His behavior becomes more erratic and violent, leading to the deaths of several innocent people. In the end, it is revealed that Dorian has been mortally wounded by Lord Henry, who had become tired of his friend's selfishness.

**The final confrontation**

In a tragic finale, Dorian realizes too late the true horror of his own actions and the damage he has caused to those around him. The novel ends with the discovery of Dorian's dead body, while the portrait, now a twisted and grotesque reflection of his soul, remains untouched, a testament to the enduring power of vanity and corruption.

Throughout the novel, Dr. Seward serves as a voice of reason and morality, recording his observations of Dorian's descent into madness in his diary. However, it is ultimately Dorian Gray who drives the plot and explores themes of the supernatural, vanity, and the human condition.
